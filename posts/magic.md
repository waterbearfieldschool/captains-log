Site visit and brainstorm ...

Posts at corners of hexagon are 4x6", should be 6' long;

Looks like 4x6"x12' are $30 ea at home depot [here](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/4-in-x-6-in-x-12-ft-2-Pressure-Treated-Ground-Contact-Southern-Pine-Timber-260430/100062638)

So that's 3x$30 = $90 for six posts of 6' each ...

Compare -- a fence from Home depot, get 2-panels for $90, would likely need 2 of them so ~ $180 materials (reference [here](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Zippity-Outdoor-Products-Portable-Puppy-1-9-ft-H-x-3-6-ft-W-Slatted-Panel-Flat-Top-WoodTek-Vinyl-Cedar-Color-Fence-Kit-2-Pack-ZP19072/323870979)

## Fence Design #1

The first task is to make a 13 foot fence around the 'construction zone'. 

Originally, we'd discussed the idea of fence design that would utilize found wood, with a 'Sturbridge Village' construction, perhaps something like this:

However, we eventually decided that it would be more important to have a fence that was easy to disassemble and transport.

The concept we're working on instead is to build a fence out of modular 'frames' built with regular lumber, which then have 'pickets' or 'fences' that consist of found sticks and branches. Ideally, students would find and place these sticks into the frame, and the sticks would be fastened / lashed to the frame for durability.

These frames would then be arranged to make a 13 foot fence, with a 3 foot wide hinged gate.  The frames would attach to eachther somehow (with metal hardware, or perhaps even lashed), and could be moved or disassembled when desired.

We're looking to build the fence using found & recycled lumber as much as possible.

## Fence Design #2

Fri 10 Jan 2025 06:54:53 PM EST

After reviewing the regulations around playground construction, we realized that we needed to be quite strict about maintaining a maximum distance between fence 'pickets' of 3.5".  

To do this, we can still retain the 'frame' of our overall fence design:

But we need to rethink how we'll be designing the 'pickets'.  

### Picket Option A: Wooden Slats

Our first idea is to simply use 1"x3" pieces of lumber as pickets.  The individual pickets could easily be painted or customized by students.

This option is relatively easy to build.  The only downside might be the cost of the lumber for the pickets.  

In order to get a feel for this option, we've begun with a few 1"x3"x8" boards ...

### Picket Option B:  Wire Mesh

Another simple, and less expensive option would be to use wire mesh instead of pickets.  This is a common design in various gardens.

### Picket Option C:  Natural Pickets

We could still retain a more 'natural' look, as in the original concept, by using found sticks for the pickets.  This is more laborious to build (finding sticks of the appropriate size and shape will also take some time), but less expesnive.
