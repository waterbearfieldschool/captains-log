Site visit and brainstorm ...

Posts at corners of hexagon are 4x6", should be 6' long;

Looks like 4x6"x12' are $30 ea at home depot [here](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/4-in-x-6-in-x-12-ft-2-Pressure-Treated-Ground-Contact-Southern-Pine-Timber-260430/100062638)

So that's 3x$30 = $90 for six posts of 6' each ...

Compare -- a fence from Home depot, get 2-panels for $90, would likely need 2 of them so ~ $180 materials (reference [here](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Zippity-Outdoor-Products-Portable-Puppy-1-9-ft-H-x-3-6-ft-W-Slatted-Panel-Flat-Top-WoodTek-Vinyl-Cedar-Color-Fence-Kit-2-Pack-ZP19072/323870979)
