Site visit and brainstorm ...

Posts at corners of hexagon are 4x6", should be 6' long;

Looks like 4x6"x12' are $30 ea at home depot [here](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/4-in-x-6-in-x-12-ft-2-Pressure-Treated-Ground-Contact-Southern-Pine-Timber-260430/100062638)

So that's 3x$30 = $90 for six posts of 6' each ...

Compare -- a fence from Home depot, get 2-panels for $90, would likely need 2 of them so ~ $180 materials (reference [here](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Zippity-Outdoor-Products-Portable-Puppy-1-9-ft-H-x-3-6-ft-W-Slatted-Panel-Flat-Top-WoodTek-Vinyl-Cedar-Color-Fence-Kit-2-Pack-ZP19072/323870979)

## Fence Design #1

The first task is to make a 13 foot fence around the 'construction zone'.  The two core design ideas we're working with are:
- making a fence out of natural and found materials;
- making a fence that is easy to disassemble and transport

The concept we're working on right now is to build a fence out of modular 'frames' built with regular lumber, which then have 'pickets' or 'fences' that consist of found sticks and branches. Ideally, students would find and place these sticks into the frame, and the sticks would be fastened / lashed to the frame for durability.

These frames would then be arranged to make a 13 foot fence, with a 3 foot wide hinged gate.  The frames would attach to eachther somehow (with metal hardware, or perhaps even lashed), and could be moved or disassembled when desired.

Estimates for materials cost if purchased at e.g. Home Depot is calculated in a Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p5d0SLIdF_imkuD9RXHpqbvSMv4NHEZS-tepf4vk4Fs/edit?usp=sharing) -- current rough estimate is about **$185**.

Meanwhile, we're looking to build the fence using found & recycled lumber as much as possible.
