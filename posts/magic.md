Site visit and brainstorm ...

Posts at corners of hexagon are 4x6", should be 6' long;

Looks like 4x6"x12' are $30 ea at home depot [here](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/4-in-x-6-in-x-12-ft-2-Pressure-Treated-Ground-Contact-Southern-Pine-Timber-260430/100062638)

So that's 3x$30 = $90 for six posts of 6' each ...
