On Tuesday we met with Pete at Artisan's Asylum, where he showed us his 'DIY Loom' project.  It's part of a 5-day 'Fiber to Fabric' class that he is helping to create that will take students through the process of making textiles, from raw cotton to woven cloth.

Another class in this vein, which Pete has already helped create and run once, is 'Dirt to Machine', which involves melting down aluminum (eventually, they hope to start by smelting iron) and then building a small machine using metalworking tools in the machine shop.
 
The current DIY loom design is a Dutch design that doesn't quite fit the planned class activities;  Pete is working on a re-design now.
