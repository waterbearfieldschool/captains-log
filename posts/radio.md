# Meeting Agenda for Monday, Jan 6th 2025

## Round of introductions ...

- Who are you? :)
- How did you find your way to this group? :)
- What are your interests and goals in radio / alternative communications systems?
- What would you like this group to be for you? 

## Miscellaneous topics we might discuss

- Ham licensing -- what it might be useful for, what is required
- Do folks want to study together for a next ham exam? 
- Based on where folks are located, might we try to regularly communicate long-distance via ham radios?  What hardware / licenses would be required?
- Might we organize a regular monthly 'check-in' to get in habit of maintaining contact via alternative channel ... could be a fun social event ... and good preparation for a 'grid-down' event
- Local backup comms via walkie-talkies ... what range? What are the options?  APRS as a wide-range local digital logistics comm option (requires ham license)
- Meshtastic -- no license required for radio, low-costs, local (1 km to 5 km) range (but with internet hops), leverages phone for interface -- easy place to begin experimenting
- TD-H3 from Tidradio as a great starter radio 
- Software-defined radio (SDR) dongles as a great way to start receiving radio signals, learning
- [Broadcastify](https://www.broadcastify.com/listen/) as a way to listen to various radio bands online
- GMRS as nice place to start -- wider range, repeaters available, license is $35 and covers household for 10 years
