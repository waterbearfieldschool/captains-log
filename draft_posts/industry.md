We had a fantastic visit at the [Charles River Museum of Industry and Innovation](https://www.charlesrivermuseum.org/) in Waltham.  Nick gave us a great tour, and we were able to see several machines in the machine shop in operation, powered by a rod that, back in the day was ultimately water-powered.  

Several museum displays seemed like they could provide inspiration for great Field School projects -- watch making, locomotion, chopstick recycling, a generator, and water power in general.  It so happens that a few days later, Pete described the 'Fiber to Fabric' class he's helping to put together at Artisan's Asylum in Allston.  We're now chatting with him about the idea of offering the class -- or, pieces of it -- at the Museum.
