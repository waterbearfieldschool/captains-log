# Winter 2025 Seminar Topics

We're planning a series of short, informal presentations and discussions around topics of interest to the group. Below is a rough, to-be-refined categorization of technologies that seem to be of interest:

## Listening-only (short and long range, no license required)

In general, it is often useful in a grid-down scenario to be able to listen into ambient broadcasts (news, fire, police, emergency services).  There are various inexpensive approaches to this, including:
- **scanners** -- small radios that can receive local police, fire, and other broadcasts
- **software-defined radios** -- inexpensive dongles that, when connected to a laptop, can provide an intuitive graphical way of exploring received radio signals
- **short-wave radios** -- radios optimized for receiving broadcasts from around the globe

## Short-range transceivers (several miles), no ham license

These are relatively inexpensive radio technologies that allow for off-grid communication within a range of a few miles (or tens of miles, with repeater nodes).   This would be useful for folks on a homestead, or perhpas within a relatively small town, to stay in touch.

- **Meshtastic** (enables phone to do off-grid, mesh-networked texting via an inexpensive add-on module; unlicensed)
- **GMRS** (audio communication; a $35, no-exam license is required)
- **Walkie Talkies** (audio communication; no license required)

## Medium-range transceivers (100s of miles), ham license req'd

For off-grid coordination of logistics (food, water, transport) -- e.g. after or during a storm, flood, or fire -- it seems often to be useful to communicate within a range of a few hundred miles.  A typical approach to this is to a technique ([NVIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_vertical_incidence_skywave)) that bounces radio signals off the atmosphere nearly directly above the broadcasting site, so that signals land within the desired range.  The relevant bands (typically, HF), require a ham license (typically, the higher-level, 'General' license).   Example technologies include:

- **js8call; varac** -- keyboard-to-keyboard live chat, with store-and-forward capability
- **winlink** -- ham radio-based email program
