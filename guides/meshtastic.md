# Setting up a RAK 4631-based Meshtastic node

These nodes are low-power, small, inexpensive, and easy to set up.  They come with antennas that work fairly well.  

## The core module

The 4631 + 19007 Meshtastic Node is $35, [here](https://www.amazon.com/RAKwireless-WisBlock-Meshtastic-Starter-RAK19007/dp/B0CHKZJK9C?th=1)

## The screen

The OLED screen appropriate for the 4631 + 19007 is [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09X37N87L).

It comes in a package of 4 screens (share with friends!) for $10, and needs simple soldering.  

## The battery

A 2000 mAh battery with the proper connector for the 4631 + 19007 is [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7N2T1TD/ref=sspa_dk_detail_2?pd_rd_i=B0B7N2T1TD) for about $15.
